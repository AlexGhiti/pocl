Portable Computing Language (pocl) v1.5 released
-------------------------------------------------

Pocl is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the OpenCL
standard (1.2 with some 2.0 features supported). In addition to being an
easily portable multi-device open-source OpenCL implementation, a major
goal of this project is improving interoperability of diversity of
OpenCL-capable devices by integrating them to a single centrally
orchestrated platform.

Upstream pocl currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda,
HSA-supported GPUs and TCE ASIPs (experimental, see: http://openasip.org)
It also is known to have multiple (private) ports.

Release Highlights
------------------

* Support for Clang/LLVM 10.0

Please note that there's an official pocl "maintenance policy" in place.
This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite project
that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future pocl releases:
