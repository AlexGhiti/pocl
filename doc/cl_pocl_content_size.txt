    Incomplete - DO NOT SHIP

Extension Type

    OpenCL platform extension

Dependencies

    OpenCL 1.2

Overview

    This extension provides a way to to indicate
    a buffer which will hold the meaningful
    bytes of another buffer, after kernel execution.

    The implementation can use this as an optimization hint,
    to internally optimize buffer transfers in scenarios with kernels
    producing dynamic data sizes, by not transferring
    the bytes that were not written to.

    The user is responsible for maintaining the correct meaningful byte count.
    The buffer holding the byte count must be at least 64bits large.
    The meaningful byte count is stored as 64bit unsigned integer, little endian.

Header File

    cl_ext_pocl.h

New Procedures and Functions

    The extension adds a single new API entry:

    extern CL_API_ENTRY cl_int CL_API_CALL
    clSetContentSizeBufferPoCL (cl_mem  buffer,
                                cl_mem  content_size_buffer);

    This call sets the buffer in 2nd argument ("content_size_buffer")
    to hold the meaningful byte count for the content of the
    buffer in 1st argument ("buffer").
